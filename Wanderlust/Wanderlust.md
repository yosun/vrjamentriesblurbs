Wanderlust is a platform that lets you “walk into paintings.” 

You see each painting hanging on the wall, as a window “looking into the painting,” and you can choose to enter it immersively. 

 
>Controls - how is your game, app, or experience controlled? Gaze, touch pad, controller?

>Mechanics - what can a user or player expect to do or experience in this world; what are the core “gameplay” mechanics?

>Innovation - what did you try that is new or unique in VR? For example, UI / user cues, multi-user interactions, visual/audio interactions, comfortable locomotion techniques, immersive control methods, or even extending the technology in some way.

## Controls
 * "GazeLandmark Beacon" - tap to cast a virtual walking stick, final position indicated by a glow or landmark beacon. Tap again to confirm to walk there. Or, look away.  
 * Back button exits the painting. (And also toggles the GazeLandmark beacon between low-key glow to the classic map pin enshrined at the MOMA.)
 
## Mechanics 
Experience "walking through canvas" and seeing what's behind the perspective plane of the painting.

## Innovation

*Rescaling the VR camera from tiny to large and back again - a VR-only experience:* For some smaller-scaled sculptures, instead of walking into the painting, you want to turn tiny and peer at the world from the sculpture.

*A new way to walk in VR without a gamepad:* Non-intrusive hands-free walking via **"gaze tracker tele-walking stick"** 
  
1. *Set GazeLandmarkBeacon:* Simply tap your Gear VR to point your walking stick - always aimed 20 degrees in front of you (below your eyesight). A GazeLandmark beacon shows up where you pointed to in the world - even if it's far away. If you don't want to walk there, look away. The GazeLandmark beacon will turn white when you are no longer looking in that area. Find another point to walk to and tap again to tele-port your walking stick, aka, GazeLandmark Beacon. 
2. *Tap GazeLandmarkBeacon to walk there:* Look at the GazeLandmark beacon you set. When it turns green, tap again to walk there. (Path Navigation included! It's like walking while being pulled in!)

### Replica or New Interpretation? 

It’s new art in that each 3D version of a painting requires creative interpretation and extension - the original 2D painting is just “one shot” in an entire world. It’s useful in that it helps immerse the viewer in art history in an engaging and relevant way. I hope to eventually extend this platform so that anyone in the community can submit their own "3D paintings."
